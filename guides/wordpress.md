# WordPress SPLOT Guide

Alan Levine https://cog.dog â€¢ SPLOT https://splot.ca

This documentation provides general information for installing, updating, and tending to the [WordPress-based SPLOTs](https://splot.ca/category/splots/wordpress/). While each one includes its own set of specific documentation this is aimed as a general reference and also some key information for the versions previously set up via the Reclaim Hosting application installers.
